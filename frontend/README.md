## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. **Option 1: Move files to root**
   - Move the contents of the `frontend` folder (index.html, style.css, script.js) to the root of your repository.
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
   - Under "Pages", set the source to the `main` branch (root).
   - Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

2. **Option 2: Use the frontend folder**
   - Keep the files in the `frontend` folder.
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
   - Under "Pages", set the source to the `main` branch and `/frontend` as the folder.
   - Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Make sure you have an `index.html` in the published folder, or GitHub Pages will show a 404 error.
